The consequences of having convictions on one's record range from informing law enforcement's opinion of you during a traffic stop to being barred from employment/housing. Under the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, certain arrest records and convictions are eligible to be removed from someone's record. However, the process is complicated, and many people don't have the tools to get it done.

Enter, Record Bleach! Record Bleach is a full stack platform (react on the front end, rails API on the back end) , that generates the Petition for Expunction and the necessary orders. The app also informs users how to proceed once they have the Petition filled out.
